# Gold & Copper Price Analysis Framework

## Overview

A framework for analyzing gold and copper price trends based on macro factors. Core principle: **gold pricing is driven by real interest rates, central bank reserve behavior, and geopolitical uncertainty** - not simple supply/demand. Copper is tied to industrial cycles and the next technological revolution.

> **Note:** This framework was created from 2025 Q3/Q4 analysis. Some data points are historical examples. Always verify current data before making decisions.

## Part 1: Gold Analysis

### Core Pricing Model

```
Real Interest Rate = Nominal Interest Rate - Inflation Rate

Gold Direction:
- Real rates falling → Gold bullish (normal regime)
- Real rates rising → Gold bearish (normal regime)

Exception (2022+ stagflation regime):
- Correlation has turned positive in some periods
- When in doubt, check BOTH real rates AND ETF flows
```

### Seven Factors Determining Gold Prices

| # | Factor | Key Insight | How to Check |
|---|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Long-term cycle** | US-China strategic competition ongoing | News flow, tariff announcements |
| 2 | **Consensus value** | "Buy gold when afraid of being wrong" | VIX index, risk sentiment |
| 3 | **USD asset distrust** | USD/stocks/bonds "triple kill" | DXY, SPY, TLT simultaneous moves |
| 4 | **US-China tariff stance** | High gold prices don't serve either country | Trade negotiation news |
| 5 | **Crisis probability** | Lower crisis odds → range-bound; higher → trending | Geopolitical headlines |
| 6 | **Stablecoins** | PAXG etc. create new demand channels | Stablecoin market cap data |
| 7 | **ETF flows vs rhetoric** | Check actual holdings, not commentary | SPDR GLD daily holdings |

### Short-term Catalysts (Days/Weeks)

Monitor these events for tactical moves:
- **Jackson Hole** (August) - Fed Chair signals
- **FOMC meetings** (8x/year) - Rate decisions
- **JOLTS** (monthly) - Job openings
- **Non-farm payrolls** (monthly, first Friday) - Employment
- **CPI/PPI** (monthly) - Inflation readings

**Rule:** Rate cut expectations heating up → gold rises; hawkish surprise → gold corrects

### Medium-term Drivers (Months)

| Driver | Bullish Signal | Bearish Signal |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Real interest rates | Falling | Rising |
| Fed policy path | Dovish pivot | Hawkish hold |
| ETF holdings | Rising | Falling |
| Central bank buying | Accelerating | Decelerating |

### Long-term Structural Factors (Years)

**Historic shift:** Gold's share in global central bank reserves has **exceeded US treasuries for the first time in 30 years** (as of 2025).

- 2012-2021: US debt/GDP rose from 96% to 119%
- Central banks structurally reallocating away from USD
- This is secular, not cyclical

### Trading Session Analysis

| Session | Typical Contribution | Interpretation |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| Asia (Beijing time) | Lower | Retail/rebalancing flow |
| Europe | Medium | Mixed institutional |
| **US** | **Highest** | Institutional/macro flow |

**Practical tip:** If gold rallies mainly in US session, it's institutional conviction. If mainly Asia, it may be retail FOMO.

### ETF Holdings - Where to Check

| ETF | Ticker | Data Source |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| SPDR Gold Trust | GLD | [spdrgoldshares.com](https://www.spdrgoldshares.com/usa/charts-and-data/) |
| iShares Gold | IAU | Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance |
| China Gold ETF | 518880 | Shanghai Stock Exchange |

**Key metric:** If price rises but ETF holdings flat → speculative, fragile. If both rise → conviction.

## Part 2: Copper Analysis

### Seven Bullish Factors

| # | Factor | Reasoning | How to Verify |
|---|--------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Fed pivot to employment** | Stagflation → buy commodities (Buffett playbook) | Fed statement language |
| 2 | **AI infrastructure boom** | Data centers need massive power/copper | Nvidia, MSFT capex announcements |
| 3 | **US manufacturing reshoring** | Infrastructure buildout | ISM Manufacturing PMI |
| 4 | **China housing stabilization** | Demand base stabilizing | China new home prices (NBS data) |
| 5 | **Strategic reserve building** | Copper is strategic material | China import data |
| 6 | **Gold/copper ratio elevated** | Copper has catch-up potential | See threshold below |
| 7 | **Supply constraints** | New mines take 3+ years | Mining company announcements |

### Gold/Copper Ratio Thresholds

```
Gold/Copper Ratio = Gold price ($/oz) ÷ Copper price ($/lb)

Historical ranges:
- Below 400: Copper relatively expensive (favor gold)
- 400-500: Neutral
- Above 500: Copper relatively cheap (favor copper)
- Above 600: Extreme - strong copper catch-up potential

Current ratio: Search "gold copper ratio" for real-time data
```

## Part 3: Quick Decision Framework

### Gold: 4-Step Check

```
Step 1: Real interest rate trend
        └─ Fed funds rate minus Core PCE
        └─ Falling = bullish, Rising = bearish

Step 2: Central bank behavior
        └─ Check WGC quarterly reports
        └─ Net buying = bullish

Step 3: ETF flow direction
        └─ Check GLD daily holdings
        └─ Rising = bullish, Flat despite price rise = warning

Step 4: Trading session pattern
        └─ US-driven = institutional conviction
        └─ Asia-driven = retail/FOMO
```

### Copper: 4-Step Check

```
Step 1: Gold/copper ratio
        └─ Above 500 = copper undervalued
        └─ Above 600 = strong buy signal

Step 2: Manufacturing PMI
        └─ Global PMI rising = bullish copper
        └─ China PMI especially important

Step 3: AI/data center capex
        └─ Rising investment = bullish copper

Step 4: Supply pipeline
        └─ No major new mines = bullish
```

### When to Favor Gold vs Copper

| Scenario | Favor |
|----------|-------|
| Risk-off, flight to safety | Gold |
| Stagflation confirmed | Both (Buffett playbook) |
| Economic recovery, PMI rising | Copper |
| AI capex accelerating | Copper |
| Fed cutting into weakness | Gold |
| Fed cutting into strength | Copper |
| Gold/copper ratio > 600 | Copper catch-up |

---

## Part 4: Risk Management (NEW)

### Position Sizing

- Gold: 5-15% of portfolio for strategic allocation
- Copper: More volatile, 2-5% for tactical positions
- Never go all-in on single macro thesis

### Exit Signals

| Asset | Exit Signal |
|-------|-------------|
| Gold | Real rates rising sharply + ETF outflows + Fed hawkish pivot |
| Gold | Gold/silver ratio collapsing (silver outperforming = late cycle) |
| Copper | PMI rolling over + China housing weakening + ratio normalizing |
| Copper | New major mine supply coming online |

### Stop-Loss Guidelines

- Gold: Consider -8% to -10% from entry for tactical trades
- Copper: More volatile, consider -12% to -15%
- For strategic positions, use time stops (reassess thesis quarterly)

## Part 5: Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Assuming gold always rises in uncertainty | Gold can be range-bound when crisis probability is actually declining |
| Following institutional rhetoric | Check actual ETF holdings, not commentary |
| Ignoring trading session patterns | US session drives institutional moves |
| Using only USD gold price | Compare with Shanghai Gold Exchange for regional signals |
| Ignoring copper in stagflation | Copper benefits from industrial demand + inflation hedge |
| Assuming copper supply is elastic | New mines take 3+ years; supply is inelastic |
| No exit plan | Always define what would invalidate your thesis |
